This repository started as a test to see if Python could be embedded in a website. Not wanting to memorize a chapter of the bible, I thought it would be fun to make a website say my memory verse for me.

This resulted in the creation of this bible app. As a proof of concept it did not see much use til later, when I decided that having truely random devotions would be awesome for someone like me, who rarely knows where to start.

The website is hosted at the following address.
